COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Tableau

This repository contains the Tableau-based analysis of COVID-19 data across different countries and regions. The goal of the project is to answer key questions related to COVID-19, such as the total number of confirmed and recovered cases, death rates, and trends in various regions. Through visualization, the analysis provides insights into the impact and spread of the pandemic, both globally and in India.

Problem Statements

The following questions were addressed in this analysis:

	1.	Total number of confirmed cases in different nations:
	•	Visualizes the spread of the virus across countries with the number of confirmed cases.
	2.	Total number of recovered cases in different nations:
	•	Focuses on the recovery data, showing which nations had the most recoveries.
	3.	Total number of confirmed cases in India:
	•	A detailed view of India’s confirmed cases over time, highlighting the country’s pandemic trends.
	4.	Total number of recovered cases in India:
	•	Similar to confirmed cases, but focusing on recoveries in India, illustrating the efforts of the healthcare system.
	5.	Trend-line forecasting for COVID-19:
	•	A forecast based on past data to predict future trends of confirmed cases, recoveries, or deaths.
	6.	Grouping Indian states to find COVID-19 hits:
	•	An analysis of the spread of the virus within India, with a breakdown by states to identify regions most affected.
	7.	Highest death rates at the international level:
	•	Comparison of countries with the highest death rates, analyzing factors that might have contributed to the fatalities.
	8.	Least death rates:
	•	Highlights countries with the least death rates and analyzes the factors contributing to better management of the pandemic.
	9.	Variation in COVID-19 cases worldwide:
	•	Shows how COVID-19 cases varied across countries, continents, and regions to understand the global impact.
	10.	Forecasting for future and reference:
	•	A Tableau-based forecast model providing predictions on future case trends for future reference and preparedness.

Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes global COVID-19 data collected from various trusted sources. This includes:

	•	Confirmed cases
	•	Recovered cases
	•	Deaths
	•	Geographical data (countries and states)

The dataset has been cleaned and processed to make it suitable for analysis in Tableau.

Tableau Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard has been created to visualize the data and provide insights into the following areas:

	•	Global COVID-19 Spread: Interactive world map displaying confirmed and recovered cases per country.
	•	COVID-19 in India: Detailed breakdown of COVID-19 cases and recoveries in India.
	•	Death Rate Analysis: A comparison of death rates across different nations, highlighting the highest and lowest figures.
	•	Forecasting and Trend Analysis: Future trends of the pandemic based on historical data.

How to Access the Tableau Dashboard

	1.	Install Tableau Desktop (or use Tableau Public for free).
	2.	Download the Tableau workbook file from this repository.
	3.	Open the file in Tableau and explore the interactive visualizations.

Key Visualizations

	•	Global Confirmed and Recovered Cases: Map and bar chart visualizing confirmed and recovered cases worldwide.
